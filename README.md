## 📂 Projects

Here are some of the exciting data projects I’ve worked on:

### 📊 [Netflix Content Analysis with Power BI ](https://github.com/Shreyasi-Kundu/Netflix-Content-Analysis)
This project began with my curiosity around Netflix’s vast content library — I wanted to understand what makes certain titles stand out. I came across a publicly available dataset on Kaggle that contains comprehensive information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including their release year, genres, countries, and ratings.I began exploring and cleaning the data — filtering out duplicates, handling null values, and creating custom columns to categorize content types and release timelines.

My goal was to uncover key insights around Netflix's content strategy. I built a series of dynamic dashboards focusing on core KPIs like:

📅 Content Release Trends — What years saw the most releases?

🌍 Country-Wise Production — Which countries are leading in content creation?

🎭 Popular Genres — What types of shows dominate Netflix?

⭐ Average Ratings — How do TV shows compare to movies in terms of quality?

📈 Top-Rated Content by Country & Genre

During the analysis, I discovered that TV Shows have a higher average rating (7.18) compared to Movies (6.53). I also noted a significant boom in original content between 2015–2020, especially from countries like the USA, India, and the UK.

To make the dashboard truly interactive, I added slicers and filters so viewers can explore trends by genre, country, or type. The end result was a visual storytelling experience powered by data — helping viewers uncover what’s trending on Netflix with just a few clicks.
